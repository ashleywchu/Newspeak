To-Do List:

- Create show pages for "News Column"
- Create show pages for "News Feed"


- make tagging more robust:
  - specifically, the ability to create mutltiple new tags simultaneously 
    in the text field at articles/new, (logic for " " and "," delimiters)
  - also when typing a tag in the text box we want autocomplete to predict 
    or suggest the tag as you are typing
  - would like this to replace checkboxes, because having a million 
    checkboxes will get ugly

Future Features Wishlist:

- suggestive search (autocomplete, prediction)
